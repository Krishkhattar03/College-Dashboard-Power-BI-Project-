# College-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project-
 
# Project Overview

  The objective was to design and build an interactive College Dashboard in Power BI using a manually curated dataset of students and teachers.

The dashboard has two major sections:

🎓 Student Dashboard

👨‍🏫 Teacher Dashboard

Both dashboards are placed on the same report page and controlled using a slicer, allowing users to dynamically switch views between Student and Teacher insights.

# Dataset Description

The dataset was manually created in Excel with structured information for both Students and Teachers.

# Student Section Columns

Student ID, Name, Mobile No, Email

Parent’s Name & Contact

Class/Grade, Section, Date of Birth, Gender

Address, Fees Paid, Pending Fees, Total Fees

Attendance (%), Enrollment Date

Previous School Name

Emergency Contact Name & No

Scholarship (Yes/No)

# Teacher Section Columns

Teacher ID, Name, Mobile No, Email

Date of Birth, Gender, Address

Department/Subject, Qualification, Experience (Years)

Attendance (%), Salary, Bonus, Advance Payment

Teacher Dashboard

## Key Insights

> Clear comparison of Collected vs Pending Fees for students.

> Identification of students and teachers with low attendance (<75%).

> Department-wise and class-wise breakdowns for both students and teachers.

> Insights into new admissions, scholarships, payroll trends, and teacher turnover rates.

> Emergency contact details easily accessible for both students and teachers.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how Power BI can be leveraged to build dynamic and interactive dashboards for educational institutions. The dual-view functionality (Students vs Teachers) makes the dashboard more scalable, user-friendly, and insightful.

It can be extended with:

Academic performance tracking

Advanced retention models

Predictive analytics for student success and teacher workload planning
